A combination of legacy (8086 to Pentium II) Toshiba laptop service part SKUs from various places around the net from the past ten years 

Note that this does include many duplicate descriptions, is not 100% accurate, and is by no means complete.  I'm hoping that the Google picks this up and references it so that others can search it for the vintage parts that they need to service their vintage Toshiba laptops.

(I happened upon over 2000 Toshiba laptop parts from Computer Reset, and this list came in handy for cataloging them.)
